About five years ago, there was a big push in physics and astronomy to attempt to bring the proportion of
men and women in the field into parity. While there is still much work to be done, I believe there has been
at least some progress in the right direction. With the current Black Lives Matter movement, there is a new
push to encourage more African Americans and other under-represented minorities into Physics and Astronomy. 
We are currently in the early stages of figuring out how to change our recruitment and education methods that
have too long neglected diverse populations. To solve this issue and achieve more diversity in Astronomy, we
will have to break old habits, and create ones. The field needs diverse people and perspectives and the creativity 
that comes along with that. There is currently a lot of discussion about how to make this happen, but the hard
part will be putting those words into action. Stay tuned!

One of the challenges that I have experienced while working in Astronomy is dealing 
with the fact that I am surrounded by really smart people. In nearly any topic, including
one that I feel very confident in discussing, there is always somebody who has more exprience,
or has thought of something that I missed.

We must think of this not as a problem with astronomy, but as benefit of astronomy. The
most difficult part of this is being okay with working around people who can be annoyingly
clever. But we must NOT dispare and think, well let's leave it all to them because we all have a place
in astronomy, from the Nobel Laureate and Tenured professor, to graduate students, undergradudates,
and high school students. We all have something to offer.

The training in astronomy is longer and more onerous than it is in many other fields. This is, in part, because there is
a long history in astronomy that we all must learn. In addition, the field is constantly changing.
For example, the theories that attempt to explain how planets form have had two revolutions since 1995.
That's only a little over 20 years and the field of planet formation has been turned on it's head...twice.

When astronomers detected the first hot jupiters, theoriests had to completely revamp their work in order
to account for their mysterious presence. Less than two decades later, after the launch of Kepler in 2009,
the first data brought down by Kepler showed that planets smaller than 4 Earth radii, which had not yet 
been discovered outside of the solar system, are the most common planets in the Galaxy.

I'm telling you this to inspire your persistence and encourage you to push through the hardships that you
will encounter in Astronomy, because even the most famous astronomers have had to do the same. We must
not only stand confident in what we know, but also be open to new ideas.  This can be a difficult
balance to hold, but it is critical that we do.
